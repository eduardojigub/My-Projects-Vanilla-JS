# My-Projects-Vanilla-JS
 In this repository, i'll add all the projects I did during my javascript study. 

<h4>#01 - Drum Kit</h4>

In this project, we use javascript to manipulate the DOM and create a drum set using the keyboard.

<h4>#02 - Clock </h4>

A clock using javascript functions and CSS

<h4>#03 - Lamp </h4>

A lamp that changes his state when pressing a button. Made using JS DOM and Conditional Statements

<h4>#04 - IMC Calculator </h4>

Another JS project using concepts like DOM and functions as well as Conditional Statements to calculate user's IMC. 

<h4>#05 - Traffic Light </h4>

A traffic light that changes his state when clicking a button. Made using JS DOM and Conditional Statements

<h4>#06-Pokedex </h4>

A Pokedex made using the POKE API (fetch function). 

<h4>#07-Ape Face </h4>

Using DOM to manipulate all HTML elements, it's possible to change the image on each click on the webpage. 

<h4>#08-Array Cards </h4>

Using HOF's like MAP, in this project we can dynamically insert new data into an array and it can be rendered automatically.

<h4>#09-Hover Simple </h4>

In This project, i just added 2 event listeners to show the "hover CSS" on the circle. 

<h4>#10-Harry-Potter-Input-Search </h4>

Using HOF's (.map) and fetching an API, i have created a "filtering" system to filter Harry Potters characters by name. 

<h4>#11-Color-Flipper </h4> 

In this project, i have used DOM to manipulate the HTML and a function to generate the next color in an array. 

<h4>#12-Counter </h4>

Using javascript functions and DOM, The idea here was to create a counter-like functionality.

<h4>#14-Converter-Currency </h4>

Using an API and HTML/CSS, i created a currency converter using Javascript. 

<h4>#15-Financial-Dashboard  </h4>

This was the hardest project until now. In this project we had to work with many DOM concepts and functions, but besides that, I think the big difference of this project is the organization necessary for it to work correctly. It was a very difficult project inspired by a youtube video.
